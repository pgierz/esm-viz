# Configuration of where the data for monitoring should be copied to on the
# VISUALIZATION host. Note that this replaces everything up to your main user
# directory on the supercomputer to keep the experiment trees looking as
# similar as possible. In this example file this means that the monitoring
# files will be copied from:
